GAME Instructions: 

Play the tasks in order as they are on the paper

To complete a task, click the mouse when crosshair hovers over object,
then walk to its specific trigger

  Task       :  Object 	 :    Location 	 : Trigger location

Brush Teeth  : Toothbrush:  Bedroom desk : bathroom sink
Wash Pot     : Pot       : Kitchen Counter: Kitchen Sink
Perform Test : Test Cube : Kitchen Counter: Bathtub
Use Toilet   : Player    : You            : Walk into toilet
Go to bed    : Player    : You            : walk into bed


Other implemented features that we couldnt get to work:

Fade away when going to bed: When going to bed i have a functioning
canvas fade, but it does not work when loading the scene again.
It runs but the scene loading is too fast for the fade to occur.

Tasking order, tasks can only really be completed in order, but
it is possible to skip some tasks along the way possibly. That is a future fix that needs to be implemented.

HINTS ALONG THE WAY IF YOU COULDNT FIGURE IT OUT:
Walk into the kitchen and checkout the vent, that wall looks walkthroughable.
do this again and again, Also please make sure to checkout the task paper in between each scene.
